**What's the result of my work for this webpage?** <BR />
I made a weather board using JavaScript, AJAX, CSS, and HTML to display the current weather for a city and the 5-day forecast.
I conditionally changed the UV Index to match the weather channel's UV Index graph.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
I learned how to use a variety of functions to populate the weather forecast. I also learned how to call upon an API to
get the weather forecast data to use in my assignment. I did a really good job of describing my code in this one.
